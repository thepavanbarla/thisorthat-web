        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing
        legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will

        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate. We will only use
        personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
        authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid
        requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
        verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your identity from the
        information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
        additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and
        for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
        additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
